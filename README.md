# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engeneering is the use of engeneering principles,methods and tools to come up with high quality software sytems.
The importance of software engineering is that it helps in creation of software an systems that power modern life activities.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
creation of  FORTRAN in 1957,first high level programming language
Advent of structured programming in the 1970s
The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
software Design- involves identifying the proplems that require a solution
Softwaree Development- Involves codind or coming up with solutions to the design.
Testing-carrying out tests to ensure it meets the users requiremnts.
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall involves sequential phases flowing downloads while agile is incremental and allows flexibility.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software Developer writes the code to the design.
Quality assurance engineer ensures the software is of quality by coming up with tests to make sure it is of quality.
Project manager oversees the whole process of planning, execution and delivery

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide tools for writing, debugging and testing the code
vcs provide tools that detect changes to source code and enables coordination of work among teams
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing user requirements and can be encountered through using agile method
Tight datelines-can be encountered through proper communication

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing involve testing individual components
intergration testing involves testing a combination of components
system testing is testing the entire software or system.
Aceptance testin is the testing against the user requirement

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is the use of texts to come up with useful response from a language model
prompt engineering enables AI models come up with responses that are in line with what is being asked.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Tell me more about dog
give the behavioral characteristics of a german shepheard
The improved prompt ensures more accurate answers
